This library management system project, developed using Core Java, MySQL, and Hibernate, includes essential features for managing a library. Here’s a summary of its main components:

User Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to access the library system, ensuring security and user-specific access.

Book Management (Admin): The admin has privileges to add new books to the library database, including details like title and author, making it easy to expand the collection.

View Available Books: All users can view the current list of available books, providing a clear view of options for borrowing.

Borrow and Return Books: Users can borrow books by providing the book ID. If the book is unavailable, they’ll receive a notification. They can also return borrowed books, updating the availability status.

Exit Option: Users can exit the application smoothly.

This system leverages Hibernate for database interactions, providing a seamless experience in managing user and book data in MySQL.
